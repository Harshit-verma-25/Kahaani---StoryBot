          Stories have always been at the heart of India&apos;s culture, passing
          down wisdom, values, and imagination from one generation to another.
          With our platform, we bring these age-old tales into a fresh,
          interactive space for kids. We make mythology fun, relatable, and
          creative, so children not only listen but also learn and express
          themselves through storytelling.
